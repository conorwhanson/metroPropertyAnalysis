Good morning. My name is Conor Hanson and in September 2023 I became a homeowner in Coon Rapids.
As a milennial I found preparing for home ownership exciting and enjoyable, even if I did have to 
give up my daily oatmilk vanilla lattes and avocado toast. In June 2023 we found a home that was 
listed as "Bank owned." Everything that could go wrong did go wrong.

The "Bank" turned out to be a Savings Fund in Delaware acting as a Trustee for an LLC in California, 
which I learned was a Delaware Statutory Trust. When I discovered this through court documents, 
corporation filings, and some simple Google searching, I was furious. Our Realtor was furious. 
Even the woman at the Title Company was furious when they didn't get us our title on time and we had 
to close a second and final time on September 1st, 2023. We all know housing in this country is inaccessible
to so many who are trying to get it for the first time. This was just an added bonus.

I'm not sure what Anoka County can do about this, but if there is some way at the county level to prohibit 
private equity from playing monopoly with our local housing market I think we ought to look into that. I'm
under no illusions this would be a simple fix. I know a county's openness to permitting new entry-level home
construction is another factor in housing prices and accessibility. But given that the only reason my wife 
and I were able to buy this house was an $8,000 check from the home sale of my deceased paternal grandfather, 
I think if we can make our local residential housing market more competitive and accessible for typical 
working-class folks, we should do so. If we can help but one neighbor in Anoka County be able to get in 
a house to build a home, build generational wealth to pass on, and put down roots in this community, 
as a Christian I see that as loving our neighbors well. 
Thanks for your time.
